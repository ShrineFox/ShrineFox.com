## About
[ShrineFox.com](https://shrinefox.com) is an ``ASP.NET Blazor`` web application with several features.  
It primarily serves as my personal homepage, showcasing my latest YouTube videos, blog posts, and projects.  
But it also provides resources for modding various Persona games, such as community-made mods, patches, guides, and tools.  
See the [live site here](https://shrinefox.com).
## Features
### ShrineFox.com/Browse
Choose a game/platform, and then a type of post (mods, tools, guides) to narrow down the selection.  
Each post has a download link, and if applicable, a source code link, as well as some info about who created it, when, and what it does.  
For the selected game, a link to GameBanana is provided so users can find even more resources outside of ShrineFox.com.
### ShrineFox.com/GetStarted
Choose a platform, game, and region to see modding instructions for the selected title.  
If patches are required in order to mod the game, they are provided here as well.  
Specifically for PS2/PS3 games, users can generate a personalized list of patches.
